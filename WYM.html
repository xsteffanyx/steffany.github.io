<h2>Want You More. 14x20 in. Watercolour & Ink.</h2>
<h1>Process</h1>
<p>How Symbolism, Aestheticism, and Decadence informed this Illustration<br> Symbolists artworks are marked with flat, abstract forms.
	They all emphasized the importance of imagination and emotions over realism and rationalism, disgust at the corruption and rampant 
	materialism of the modern world and partly by a related desire to escape it into realms of the aesthetic, fantastic, erotic or 
	religious. Typically, the influence was felt as an interest in pleasure, an interest in experimental sexuality, and a fascination 
	with the bizarre, all packaged with a somewhat transgressive spirit and an aesthetic that values material excess. The decadent 
	movement was characterized by self-disgust, delight in perversion, a cynical kind of hope, and employment of crude humor and a 
	belief in the superiority of human creativity over logic and the natural world. </p>
<p>"Image" of a Woman<br>F√©licien Rops explicitly was interested in the Satanic, and he frequently sought to portray the double-threat 
	of Satan and Woman. His work was the worship of beauty disguised as the worship of evil0. Women become preferred subjects for
	expressing emotions. The portrayal of women was limited to extremes - they were depicted either as femme fatale or capricious 
	virgins.</p>
<p>B-movie Horror Posters<br>Horror features women more prominently than any other genre. An exploitation film is a film that attempts 
	to succeed financially by exploiting current trends, niche genres, or lurid content. Exploitation films are generally low-quality 
	"B movies". Horror films in this genre include scenes of explicit violence primarily directed toward women, often occurring during 
	or juxtaposed to mildly erotic scenes. Decadence on Charles Baudelaire's terms: a preference for what is beautiful and what is 
	exotic, an ease with surrendering to fantasy, and a maturity of skill with manipulating language. These films are designed to 
	align spectators not with the male tormentor, but with the female victim</p>
<p>Madonna/Whore Dichotomy<br>The "Final Girl" is virginal, responsible, and the lone survivor. The horror genre favorite victims: 
	women who survive because they're virtuous. She combines the functions of a suffering victim and an avenging hero. There is an 
	emphasis on acknowledging the unique horrors of the female experience. Women of horror are no longer illustrating society's fears 
	on their behalf, but rather bringing the private fears of women into glaring light.</p>
<p>The 2 Extreme Images of Women<br>1. The respectable and honorable Madonna, possessing and protecting social virtue, object of 
	worship and everything that all women should aspire to. 2. Any woman who fails to live up to the Madonna is a disgusting and
	contemptible Whore driven exclusively by sexual desire thus lacking in morality and humanity.</p>
