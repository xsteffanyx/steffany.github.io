<h1>On Mayan Cosmology</h1>	
<h1>2025 - OCAD YEAR 3</h1>

<p>In this experimental typography project, I created a time-based media piece centered on the concept of revolution. Drawing from 
	both the political and transformative meanings of the word, I explored how type could move, evolve, and disrupt visually. I began 
	with in-depth research and developed a storyboard to plan the visual style, pacing, and audio. I chose a typeface that suited the 
	tone of my concept and experimented with digital techniques in AfterEffects to push the expressive boundaries of type. The final 
    film incorporated motion, rhythm, and conceptual storytelling. </p>

<h1>Process</h1>
<p>What is Revolution to Me? <br> I chose the astronomical definition of revolution‚Äîthe orbital motion of a celestial body around another
	celestial body‚Äîas inspiration for the film because it reminded me of the cyclical patterns found both in nature and in human 
	belief systems. I thought about how the Mayans perceived time and existence as cyclical rather than linear. The Aztecs‚Äô 
	understanding of the cosmos was deeply tied to the movement of celestial bodies. They believed that cosmic order and human destiny
	were intertwined with these celestial revolutions. In this film I sought to teach people about a part of this cosmology, 
	specifically the Mayan belief that human sacrifice was necessary to maintain cosmic balance and ensure the sun‚Äôs continued rise.</p>
<p>Brainstorming for Visuals <br> I wanted to merge antiquity and modernity in this film, to bring information around this ancient
	civilization to contemporary viewers. To visualize chaos and the instability in destruction and (re)creation, I chose to portray 
	this with digital chaos. The imagery and the text would distort and go back to normal constantly through its run time, 
	keeping in theme with Mayan fragmentation.</p>
<p>My Typographic Choices<br>I ultimately chose to use Dedica for my film because with the amount of heavy glitching and video 
	manipulation in the film its important to have a clean design with high legibility. Using a single typeface like Dedica prevents 
	visual clutter and maintains consistency, the font is serifed but the serifs are very interesting, they don‚Äôt follow the
	typical rules found in transitional typefaces.</p>
<p>Blending Music<br>In terms of soundtrack or sound effects, I wanted to develop something new. I gathered music from classic music 
	- Background Noise by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the Gone Girl soundtrack, native Latin American bird noises - Quetzal by
	Studio 69, native rain and drums Cimientos del Cielo by Mbm, and lastly I created distorted whispering by changing the pitch and 
	speed.</p>
