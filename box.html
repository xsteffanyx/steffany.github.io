<h1>Inclusive Packaging Design for Special-Needs</h1>	
<h1>2024 - OCAD YEAR 3</h1>
<p>In this project, I focused on reimagining packaging design to better serve a specific special-needs consumer group. After researching 
	a range of underserved populations, I identified a group whose needs are often overlooked in mainstream packaging. I conducted 
	thorough analysis‚Äîincluding store checks and product comparisons‚Äîto understand their limitations, habits, and daily challenges. 
	I then developed a new hypothetical brand to improve both accessibility and user experience. My design considered not only surface 
	graphics and brand communication, but also form, ergonomics, and ease of access‚Äîensuring a more inclusive, functional, and 
	dignified experience for the end user.</p>

<h1>Ideation</h1>
<p>Meal Replacements<br>I chose to design my own hypothetical brand of meal replacements, I believe meal replacements can be more 
	appealing and accessible to consumers in both branding and packaging design. Gastrointestinal issues are very common 
	co-morbidities among the disabled, effecting both young and older people. Cutting down on the amount of solid food to help relieve 
	symptoms or ease the stresses of life but may lead to deficiencies in nutrients. Malnutrition is a common issue with those with 
	limited diets and limited mental and physical energy/strength. Meal replacements help to combat these issues by providing a 
	temporary option for who can't eat "healthy food". <br> ‚ÄúFor some people, even healthy foods‚Äîsuch as cauliflower, cashews, lentils, 
	onions, peaches, and wheat‚Äîcan cause gas, bloating, and discomfort. That's because foods like these contain hard-to-digest 
	carbohydrates called fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols, aka FODMAPs.‚Äù ‚Äî Wathsala S Nanayakkara</p>
<p>Our Clientele<br>The clientele for Hush are health-conscious individuals dealing with gastrointestinal (GI) issues. They value 
	gentle, nutritious solutions that support their well-being without aggravating their conditions. They appreciate transparency, 
	clean ingredients, and a brand that understands their needs while offering a calming, supportive experience.
<p>Our Brand<br>The brand design has calming aesthetics, clean typography, and minimalist visuals that evoke trust and simplicity. 
	Soft, soothing colors and gentle branding elements communicate ease and comfort, mirroring the product's gentle impact on digestion.
	We reinforce our commitment to providing a trustworthy, gut-friendly solution for their health and wellness.</p>
<p>Why Hush?<br>"Hush" is effective because it conveys a sense of calmness, gentleness, and relief‚Äîqualities appealing to those with 
	sensitive digestive systems. The name suggests that the product is soothing, easy on the stomach, and helps quiet digestive 
	discomfort. It's short, memorable, and evokes a feeling of trust and care, aligning well with the needs and preferences of the
	 target audience.</p>
<p>Logo Rationale<br>The final logo design, featuring the soft rounded typeface Dalliance and a swirl in the "H" of Hush, was chosen 
	for its ability to balance elegance, comfort, and relevance to the brand‚Äôs mission. The rounded typeface conveys warmth and 
	approachability, reflecting the product‚Äôs gentle nature. The swirl in the "H" adds a unique, organic element that subtly symbolizes 
	flow and harmony, resonating with the idea of smooth digestion and internal balance. The decision to use an abstract GI tract with
	emphasized symmetry as the final logo was driven by its ability to balance clarity, relevance, and visual appeal. The abstract
	design subtly communicates the focus on digestive health without being overly clinical, making it approachable for a broader audience.
	Symmetry conveys a sense of harmony and balance. This design is simple yet distinctive, ensuring it is versatile across packaging, 
	digital, and print mediums while maintaining a professional and soothing aesthetic.</p>
