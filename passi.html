<h1>Passiflora</h1>	
<h1>2024 - OCAD YEAR 3</h1>
<p>For this project, I was tasked with designing a brand identity based on the personality and values of a classmate. Through a series 
	of in-depth conversations, I gathered insights into my classmate Laura's character traits, beliefs, passions, and aesthetics. I 
	synthesized this information into three core attributes that formed the foundation of their personal brand. From there, I developed 
	a brand name that symbolized their essence, selected a typeface that reflected their tone and presence, and crafted supporting 
	visual elements including color, texture/graphics, and modifications to typography. This project challenged me to transform abstract 
	human qualities into a clear, expressive, and authentic visual identity.</p>

<h1>Process</h1>
<p>Defining Laura<br>The Process of Turning Laura into a Brand: This section of my process delves into the steps I took to turn
    Laura into a brand. Starting off with defining her attributes as a person from the interview, turning those traits into a visual
    mood-board, and lastly finding a name and style which combines all this research into a cohesive brand.</p>
<p>Warm. (showing or expressive of enthusiasm, affection, or kindness.) <br> Multifaceted. (full of complicated details, having
    intricate patterns and motifs) <br> Passionate. (having or showing strong feelings of enthusiasm or belief) <br>
    I believe these words capture Laura in essence and are excellent for branding because they evoke powerful emotional and 
    psychological responses. They makes the brand feel human, creates a sense of authenticity and versatility.</p>
<p>Names for the Brand Brainstorm<br>Maracuj√°. (Maracuj√° is passion fruit in Portuguese) <br> Passiflora. (The scientific 
    name of the plant the passion fruit is grown from) <br> Sol-ful. (Sol meaning Sun is turned into an English word ‚ÄúSoulful‚Äù) <br>
    Her affinity to the summer, yellow, florals, the sun, and Brazilian background lead me to look for names that encompass these
    qualities. I leaned toward her mother language, Portuguese. I really focused on the words passionate and warm for the names. </p>
<p>Typeface and Colour Palette Rationale<br>My final typeface was chosen for its stem-like lines, mix of san-serif and serif elements, 
    and reminded me of stereotypical ‚ÄúTiki‚Äù typefaces so many tropical locations are branded with but more sophisticated. My colours 
    taken from the passiflora flower and the sun, containing muted colours.</p>
<p>The Final Design<br>What makes the final stand out, to me, is its feminine quality. The blue and yellow refer to the sun and the sky, 
    I was very inclined to use the mandala (also known as the ‚Äúflower of life,‚Äù) it is subtle and elegantly placed with the driving focus 
    still being the brand name. Overall, I think this iteration embodies the beauty I saw in Laura.</p>
